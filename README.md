There are 2 different codes for the same output. 

The first one is using an interface from which the user can decide the output the code will display.
The second one is using the shell. 

In both cases, it is first requiered to download the nuclei datas : the specj and M1 files. 
To simplify everything, please download everything in a newly-created folder on your computer and lunch the codes from there.

Both code give the same result. However both are given in case one wouldn't run.
